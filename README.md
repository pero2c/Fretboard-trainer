# Fretboard-trainer
An app for practicing notes on stringed instrument fretboards. Uses vanilla JavaScript and CSS.

A string and note are selected randomly, and the user has to click the matching fret on the fretboard to score points. Users don't have to start the timer to be prompted by the challenges.

Customizability:

* Custom string amounts (1-9)
* Custom tunings
* Custom time limit
* The user can select exactly which strings are active for challenges. For example, if the user wants to practice finding notes on the two thinnest strings only, the rest can be disabled by unchecking the checkboxes next to the strings.
